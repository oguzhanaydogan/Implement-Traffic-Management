Task2: I did theirs configures and peerings from virtual network.

Task3: I tested the virtual networks peering by using Network Watcher.

Task4: I created 2 route tables from vnet2 to vnet3 and vnet3 to vnet2.

Task5: I implemented an Load Balancer the two virtual machines in the hub virtual network.
